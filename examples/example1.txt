@entity color: value: any;
@entity node: value: int;
@entity edge: node1: node, node2: node;
@entity assign: node: node, color: color;

define node as n
    from edge, edge as e2
	where node1=n and e2.node1=n;

define color as c
    from assign, node as n
	where color=c and value=5;


guess exactly 1 a: (c) with assign(node=n, color=c) as a 
	from node as n, color as c
		where n;

define node
	from node as n, assign as a 
		where a.node=n.value;
